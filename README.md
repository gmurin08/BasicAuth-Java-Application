# BasicAuth-Java/Maven-Application

The purpose of this repository is to serve as an example of a basic auth implementation in the Java back-end envrionment. The application itself is rather bare bones, but it serves as an important starting point in developing a secure web application. 

Upon running and compiling, the application will proceed to a login page and request user credentials. Once a valid username and password are entered, the user may proceed to access data based on the given profile for said user. 

Future potential improvements to the application are many and include improving the UX by implementing styling, implementing a more robust Modern OAuth security schema, and building out the application into a larger web application such as a gaming website as detailed in our example.

<b>Instructions For Use</b>:

1. Upon downloading the file, unzip its contents into a directory of your choosings and import the project into eclipse as a new Maven project. 
2. Further instructions for building and running the application can be found here: <br><br>
